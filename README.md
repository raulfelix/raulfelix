### G'day mate 👋 ⚽️

I specialise in Front end architecture and development. I spend most of my time in the code but like to get involved in user experience and accessibility.

I like technical challenges and solving problems with the best tech Javascript has to offer. Things like React, GraphQL, Apollo Client and Styled Components. 😍

⚡ Fun fact:
I work for [Inquisitive](https://www.inquisitive.com/), building a platform to bring quality educational content to every person on Earth 🎓 🌏.
